# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ **briantgil/briantgil** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I have been a technology professional since 2010. Initially, I attended community college for business. I graduated from Canisius College with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Management Information Systems. I have passed certification exams for CompTIAâ€™s Network+, A+, and Security+. However, I allowed my Network+ certification to expire.
